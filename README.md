# Password-Generator
This is UTSA Coding Bootcamp's week #3 homework that generates a password utilizing javascript.  It required pop-up prompts for confirming what type of password the user wants, but pop-ups are an absolute no for me in web pages I develop.  

So I modified the types to be embedded within the page and any errors to be corrected or displayed within the password input box.

-Select a length from 8 to 128 characters (16 is default).

-Select at least one of the character types (Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, and Special).

-Click "Generate Button" to generate your password.

-Generated password will be shown in the large text area readonly input, for which you can copy.
